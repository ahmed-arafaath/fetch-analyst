   <br>
   Solution:
   * products_EDA.ipynb - Has the data exploration analysis for the products dataset
   * users_EDA.ipynb - Has the data exploration analysis for users dataset
   * transaction_EDA.ipynb - Has the data exploration analysis for the transactions dataset
   * EDA_Cont_N_SQL.ipynb - Has match rate exploration

3. Second: provide SQL queries - Answer three of the following questions with at least one question coming from the closed-ended and one from the open-ended question set. Each question should be answered using one query.<br>
Solution:
    * EDA_Cont_N_SQL.ipynb - Has answers to all the 6 question

*Note: Some assumptions were made as part of the business operations to validate the data, the notebook will have them laid out, if any assumption is missing, let me know, I'll add it to the report.*

3. Third: communicate with stakeholders - Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who is not familiar with your day-to-day work. Summarize the results of your investigation. Include:<br>
